- Amazing documentation & examples
- Easy to use and learn
- Consistency
- Find a balance between batteries included and bare essentials
- Providing the same basic API for both ocaml and bucklescript
- Provide platoform specific features where it makes sense
- Strike a balance between JS and Ocaml conventions
- Safety. Exceptions that can throw are not the default, well documented
- Pragmatism over purity. While Foldable Magmas are pretty,
- Portability
