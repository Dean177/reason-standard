## Future

- [ ] Bool
- [ ] Vector (Immutable, Growable array-like)
- [ ] Buffer: file:///Users/deanmerchant/.opam/4.07.1/var/cache/odig/html/base/Base/Buffer/index.html
- [ ] Random
  - file:///Users/deanmerchant/.opam/4.07.1/var/cache/odig/html/base/Base/Random/index.html
  - https://github.com/boo1ean/casual#readme
- [ ] Seq
  - https://ocamlverse.github.io/content/iterators.html
  - https://immutable-js.github.io/immutable-js/docs/#/Seq
    Seq describes a lazy operation, allowing them to efficiently chain use of all the higher-order collection methods (such as map and filter) by not creating intermediate collections.
- [ ] MutQueue
- [ ] Queue
- [ ] Dqueue
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Heap
- [ ] Exn
      What are exceptions?
      How do you use them?
      Should you use them?
